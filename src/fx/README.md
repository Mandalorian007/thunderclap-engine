GPU particles and allocation-free light helpers. No dependencies.

## Particles

```ts
import { ParticleEmitter, ParticleSystem } from '@thunderclap/engine/fx';

const particles = new ParticleSystem(renderer, { capacity: 32768, floorY: 1000 });
// createGame builds one as ctx.particles (options: CreateGameOptions.particles) and updates it.

particles.emit({ x: 960, y: 540, shape: { kind: 'circle', radius: 20 }, colorStart: [4, 2, 0.5, 1] }, 64);

const embers = new ParticleEmitter(particles, { x: 400, y: 900, colorStart: [3, 1, 0.2, 1] }, 30);
embers.update(dt);           // 30 particles/s; mutate embers.params freely
embers.burst(20, { speed: [300, 600] });

// each frame, inside the scene's render:
frame.drawable(particles);   // order and layers optional, like any draw
```

- `ParticleSystem(renderer, opts?: ParticleSystemOptions)`: `capacity` (ring buffer, default
  65536; when full the oldest are overwritten), `maxSpawnsPerFrame` (256), `floorY` (a bouncy
  floor, logical y), `bounce` (0.35), `stretch` (velocity streak, 0.02 s). Spawn and integrate run
  in compute (`prepare(encoder)`, called by the renderer); `update(dt)` only advances time.
  `clear()` kills every particle on the next `prepare`; `destroy()` frees the buffers.
- Particles draw as additive, velocity-stretched quads into both scene targets (colour and
  emissive, so they bloom). With a depth camera (`frame.depthFormat` set) `draw` uses a pipeline
  that tests depth without writing it, built once per depth format.
- `EmitParams`: `x`, `y`, `shape` (`EmitShape`: `point`, `circle { radius }`, `rect { width,
  height }`, `line { dx, dy }`), `angle`, `spread`, `speed`, `life`, `size`, `colorStart`,
  `colorEnd`, `gravity`, `drag`, `emissive`. Colours are linear RGBA (HDR allowed); units are
  logical px and seconds.
- `blend: 'additive' | 'alpha'` (default additive; alpha is premultiplied, for smoke and dust).
  `countAlive: true` counts live particles on the GPU each frame and reads the count back into
  `alive` (a few frames late; -1 before the first readback).
- Box and sphere shapes (`box { width, height, depth }`, `sphere { radius }`) act as `rect` and
  `circle` in 2D, which stays pixel-identical to before.

### World space

```ts
const rain = new ParticleSystem(renderer, { space: 'world', floorY: 0, bounce: 0, stretch: 0.012 });
rain.emit({
  x: 0, y: 9, z: 0,
  shape: { kind: 'box', width: 18, height: 1, depth: 18 },
  angle: -Math.PI / 2, spread: 0.05, speed: [7, 9],
  gravity: [0, -9.8, 0], wind: [1.5, -9, 0], drag: 0.4,
  colorStart: [0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 0.7],
}, 50);
const dust = new ParticleSystem(renderer, { space: 'world', blend: 'alpha', lit: true, fade: { near: 14, far: 24 } });
frame.drawable(rain);        // under a depth camera (Camera.perspective)
```

- `space: 'world'`: positions in world units, y up. The same compute kernels run with three
  components; quads face the camera (built from the `camera.view` rows) and stretch along the
  velocity projected on screen. Depth test on, depth write off.
- `EmitParams` in world space: `z`, `vz` (added to the sampled velocity), `gravity` as
  `[x, y, z]` (a pair means z 0), `wind` (`[x, y, z]`, the velocity `drag` pulls towards),
  `drag`. `angle` is in the xy plane and `spread` opens a cone around it. Defaults are
  world-sized: angle up, spread a full sphere, `speed` [0.5, 2], `size` [0.1, 0.02], gravity
  [0, -9.8, 0].
- `floorY`: the plane y = `floorY` (default none).
- `lit` (default false): each particle is shaded as a small sphere through `engine_lambert`
  (`WGSL_LIGHTS`: `frame.lights` ambient, sun, point lights). `emissive` still goes to the
  emissive target.
- `fade: { near, far }`: fade out with distance to the camera (null for none).
- `softness` (default 0.25 world units; 0 off): soft particles. `prepare` copies the scene
  depth (`depthTarget ?? renderer.target`, its `SceneTarget.depth`) into the system's own
  `depth32float` texture and the fragment fades near it. The copy is the previous frame's
  depth; draw the system on its own layer in a second view of the same camera for same-frame
  depth. Without a depth camera or before the first depth frame it is skipped.

- `ParticleEmitter(system, params, rate = 0)`: continuous emission at `rate` per second while
  `active`, plus `burst(count, overrides?)`.

## Light helpers

Pure functions of time; feed the result into a tint, emissive or light intensity.

- `flicker(t, opts?: FlickerOptions)`: flame or torch flicker, two octaves of noise plus a rare
  dip. Options `seed`, `speed` (7), `amount` (0.3), `base` (1); returns `base * (1 - amount * n)`.
- `pulse(t, opts?: PulseOptions)`: cosine breathing between `min` (0.6) and `max` (1) over
  `period` seconds (2), offset by `phase` (0..1).
- `valueNoise1(x, seed = 0)`: smooth 1D value noise in [0, 1].

Tests: `particles.test.ts`, `particles-world.test.ts` (fake GPU), `flicker.test.ts`. Demo:
`harness/weather.html`.
